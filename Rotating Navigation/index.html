          The domestic dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris)[4] is a
          domesticated descendant of the wolf. The dog derived from an ancient,
          extinct wolf,[5][6] and the modern grey wolf is the dog's nearest
          living relative.[7] The dog was the first species to be
          domesticated,[8][7] by hunterâ€“gatherers over 15,000 years ago,[6]
          before the development of agriculture.[1] Their long association with
          humans has led dogs to be uniquely adapted to human behavior,[9]
          leading to a large number of domestic individuals[10] and the ability
          to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other
          canids.[11] The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for
          various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.[12]
          Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. They perform many
          roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection,
          assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy, and aiding
          disabled people. This influence on human society has given them the
          sobriquet of "man's best friend."
